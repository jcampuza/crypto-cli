# Crypto stats cli tool

View top cryptocurrency stats quickly from the console.
Based off of some other tools I've come across.

Previously I'd have to do a couple quick google searches to check common cryptocurrencies, so I figured I'd make a simple cli tool with the stats I'm mostly interested in

## Install

```
npm install
npm run start OR node ./src/index.js
```

You can also install globally in order to run from anywhere
